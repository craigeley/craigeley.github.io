		  <div class="content"><p>It’s always a combination of exactly two things that make me want to update my website: 1) the development of a large or small life change, and 2) the desire to procrastinate from a larger and scarier task at hand. In this case, it was me finally being able to publicly announce that I’ll be working on <a href="http://ttbook.org">To the Best of Our Knowledge</a> starting in September combined with the fact that I have an essay due for a proposed book collection soon. With that in mind, I’m planning on moving to this new set-up, which is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, styled by <a href="https://twitter.com/twnsndco">Cole Townsend</a>’s <a href="http://jekyll.gtat.me/about/">Balzac theme</a>, and run from <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. There are still a ton of kinks to work out, so in the meantime the main action will still be over on <a href="http://craigeley.com/">Tumblr</a>.</p>

<p>As always, thanks for reading.</p>

we need “an Instragram for sound,” which reminded me of <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2013/12/20/reach-out-and-touch-on-audio-social-media/">this

sound doesn’t go viral in the first place.</p>

Fellow</a>. For
the next two years, I’ll be working with <a href="http://ttbook.org">To the Best of Our
Knowledge</a>, an arts and humanities radio show
produced by <a href="http://www.wpr.org/">Wisconsin Public Radio</a> and
distributed nationally by <a href="http://www.pri.org/">PRI</a>. If you’re a reader
of this blog and haven’t heard the show—or haven’t checked it on out in
a while—please do. (You can grab the podcasts in iTunes
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/pri-to-best-our-knowledge/id471896367?mt=2">here</a>.)
Each hour-long show explores a theme through in-depth interviews as well
as some shorter segments.</p>

<p>Over the last year or so, the producers of the program have been
<a href="http://www.current.org/2014/04/to-the-best-of-our-knowledge-a-weekend-staple-from-wisconsin-gets-makeover/">“rethinking the show from top to
bottom”</a>,
and I’m excited to jump in and be a part of that process in my role as
digital producer. I’ll be mostly working on online and other
non-broadcast projects to start, so keep your eyes on this space and the
<a href="http://ttbook.org">TTBOOK website</a> for more details as they unfold. I
officially start in September.</p>

<p>As excited as I am for this new opportunity, I’m equally sad to be
leaving Penn State and the <a href="http://iah.psu.edu/">IAH</a>, which has been an
incredibly supportive home for the last year. This will always be the

		<h1><a href="/05-27-2014/dragons-at-the-zoo">Dragons at the Zoo</a></h1>
		<center><span class="post-date">27 May 2014</span></center>
		  <div class="content"><p>Just a few weeks ago I posted a photo of <a href="http://craigeley.com/post/85524807267/about-two-weeks-ago-the-american-museum-of">Douglas Burden</a>, nature filmmaker and museum display innovator. Perhaps the single event that launched Burden to fame was a trip he took to Java where he successfully captured two live Komodo dragons and brought them back to the Bronx Zoo in 1927.</p>

<p>Then, over the weekend, a headline catches my eye: “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/24yregion/dragons-return-to-the-bronx-zoo.html?hpw&amp;rref=science&amp;_r=0">Dragons Return to the Bronx Zoo</a>” (NYTimes link; might need subscription). It appears as if they have some new specimens—siblings, in fact. Conveniently, the article forgets to mention that Burden’s original captors didn’t fare so well. According to Gregg Mitman:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The captured dragons were donated to the Bronx zoo, where attendance was said to have increased by thirty thousand people a day…Unfortunately, the dragons did not live long at the zoo, and the “lethargic, deflated captive” failed to give “any impression of his aggressive, alert appearance in his wild home.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in death, the dragons were able to appear more “lifelike” through the processes of taxidermy and film. Burden donated the animals to the American Museum of Natural History, where they created a taxidermic “habitat group,” and played some of Burden’s films beside the display. It was likely the first time that films accompanied a natural history museum display—though the films were silent.</p>

		<center><span class="post-date">23 May 2014</span></center>
		  <div class="content"><blockquote>
  <p>A heartbroken Wirth later said the horse was startled by what Wirth thinks was the sound of a starting gate bell coming from a commercial on Churchills massive new video board. The system includes 750 speakers. “We teach horses to break from that,” he said. “And you’ve got it on a loud speaker that everybody in a two-city block can hear. Well, what’s she going to do? She thinks shes supposed to take off. And thats what she did. And when she did, she lunged and she lost her balance and went down.”</p>

<p>That’s from a <a href="http://espn.go.com/horse-racing/story/_/id/10971859ever-tell-lynda-dies-freak-fall-churchill-downs">devastating story</a> from ESPN this morning on how a loud sound may have been responsible for the death of a horse. Theres a lot to consider hereincluding the ethics of horse racing itselfbut it reaffirms for me how much there is to be done at the intersection of sound studies and animal studies from both the sciences and the humanities.</p>

		<h1><a href="/04-28-2014/how-to-sort-of-sync-taskpaper-files-with-busycal">How to (Sort of) Sync TaskPaper files with BusyCal</a></h1>
		<center><span class="post-date">28 April 2014</span></center>
		  <div class="content"><p>Recently I switched my task management workflow from Apple’s Reminders into a Taskpaper system that uses a <a href="http://craigeley.com/post/80876964138unning-multiple-instances-of-nvalt">unique instance of nvALT</a> when I’m at my computer, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/listacular-for-dropbox-rapid/id624606571?mt=8">Listacular</a> when I’m on the go. While I like this arrangement, I had really gotten used to being able to view tasks in a calendar layout so I could easily see what was coming up next. It’s not hard to make a master list of upcoming tasks from your Taskpaper files, but then you end up with just that: another list.</p>

<p>After some Googling I saw that BusyCal has a <a href="https://support.busymac.com/help/21535-busycal-url-handler">URL handler</a>, making it possible to pass arguments into a string and create new entries from them. I wrote a <a href="https://gist.github.com/craigeley/11335910">rough script</a> that reads from Taskpaper-formatted files and sends them over to BusyCal. There are some severe limitations here, including no way to account for <code>@tags</code> (which I don’t use anyway), and no provision for duplicate entries—this will add entries every time, even you already have identical entries in BusyCal.</p>

<p><strong>Set-up</strong>: This is based on storing multiple Taskpaper files in a single folder. Those files should have the same names as your BusyCal Reminders lists.</p>

<p><img src="http://d.pr/liWQ+" alt="Like so" /></p>

<p>Once you have that established, you can run the script, which should be pretty self-explanatory. It can handle lines with and without formatted due dates. You’ll need to change the directory in line 8, and you can change your file extension to whatever you use in lines 8 and 20.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is not a sync solution—it only works one way, and I think it works best for simply viewing your upcoming items. So when I make changes to my Taskpaper files and re-run it, I literally delete all of the BusyCal todos first.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>That being said, if you do make changes in BusyCal (like dragging items to change their due dates) I have <em>sort of</em> figured out a way to bring those changes back to your Taskpaper files, but it obliterates any formatting, headers, notes, etc. in the original files—basically anything that is not an explicit to-do item. Still, if you also want to give that a try, you can use this <a href="https://gist.github.com/craigeley/9469798">Reminders to Taskpaper Applescript</a>.</p>

<p>Would love to hear how (or if) this works for you on <a href="https://twitter.com/craigeley">Twitter</a> or on the Gists.</p>

		<center><span class="post-date">10 April 2014</span></center>
		  <div class="content"><p>“You literally cannot learn when you are scared,” Dr. Kurt Fristrup told my students on Tuesday. He was talking about evolutionary biology, but also about being a student—both in college and beyond. Kurt visited my class to give a talk about the effects of noise on animals, but in his introductory remarks, he spoke about how he got to this point in his life as the senior scientist in the <a href="http://www.nature.nps.gov/sound_night/">Natural Sounds and Night Skies</a> division of the National Park Service. As <a href="http://www.nature.nps.gov/sound_night/bios.cfm">his bio</a> makes clear, he has worked several different jobs in several distinct scientific fields.</p>

<p>I’m paraphrasing here, but in essence, he told the class that the best way to go through life is not to plan for a specific career, but to plan for the futures you cannot yet imagine. He said the best things you can learn are how to be a quick learner and how to communicate clearly. From there almost anything is possible, he argued, no matter if your major is chemistry or comparative lit. It was as direct and moving and meaningful an argument for the humanities as I’ve heard recently—and I couldn’t agree more.</p>

<p>My friend Ted Thompson’s debut novel came out last week, and I can’t believe I have yet to mention it here. For starters, it’s a beautifully written and deeply moving portrait of suburban American life. But it also has some serious bite: it’s a novel that asks really timely questions about whether or not it is even possible to live an ethical and satisfying life while working within the financial system. I’m looking forward to teaching it some day—hopefully in an American studies course, where it would be perfect in a unit on the suburbs, on whiteness and masculinity, or on the financial crisis, among others. Really highly recommended.</p>

		  <div class="content"><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/craigeley/8301817">Sifttter</a> has always been about “set it and forget it” use—running silently every single night with minimal fuss and zero user interaction. But <em>by far</em> the most common request I’ve gotten is to easily create entries for different dates. There are a ton of reasons you would want to do this, especially if your primary computer is a laptop that might be closed or off at the time the script is scheduled to run. I would kludge this by force-changing my computer’s date, in part because I wasn’t confident in my ability to code a more complex date range function.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://twitter.com/fofr">Paul Hayes</a>, who Tweeted at me two weeks ago to show me how he had modified Sifttter to create straightforward Markdown files over user-specified date ranges. You can see his super useful script <a href="https://gist.github.com/fofr/8922295">here</a>. I added Paul’s elegant solution for command-line date ranges so that you can generate nice Day One entries for any old day that you choose. Here are the options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>-d, --date DATE,   'Date to generate - Any parseable date string'</code></li>
  <li><code>-s, --start START, 'Start date - Use with end to generate a range of dates'</code> </li>
  <li><code>-e, --end END,     'End date - Use with start to generate a range of dates'</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So a potential use would look like <code>ruby /path/to/sifttter.rb -s "2014-02-01" -e "2014-02-26"</code></p>

<p>I’ve used this occasion to bump Sifttter to version 1.5, which was a totally arbitrary choice. Honestly, this improves the use-cases for Sifttter so dramatically it feels like a 2.0. I’m glad I’m not an actual software developer who has to worry about that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Good luck everyone, and happy logging—let me know if something breaks or goes terribly wrong on your end.
