<p>Back in December, I went to the <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/nulab/nmalh/">New Media in American Literary History Symposium</a> hosted by Northeastern and organized by the seemingly indefatigable <a href="http://ryan.cordells.us/">Ryan Cordell</a> and Rhae Lynn Barnes, who runs <a href="http://www.ushistoryscene.com/">US History Scene</a>.</p>

<p>Despite “literary” being in the title of the event, there were a handful of us there working on audio, and we were lucky enough to have Lisa Gitelman serve as the moderator and discussant on our panel. The event was live-streamed, but if you missed it then, the good folks at the <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/nulab/">NULab</a> have recently posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXHAxVqAb4oJAnbpkPHT96VJO5wHsJF4H">all of the sessions</a>.</p>

<p>This isn’t necessarily my best work, but it is the first time I formally presented on the idea of “natural history media,” which has been really helpful as I frame out my current book project (which might be titled <em>Hearing Natural History</em>). At this point I’m pretty used to hearing the sound of my own voice, but this video was pretty challenging to get through—and I probably won’t read my notes from my phone in future presentations. Ah well.</p>

<p>Anyway: you can (and should!) see my presentation in the context of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KAhkD844H0&amp;index=9&amp;list=PLXHAxVqAb4oJAnbpkPHT96VJO5wHsJF4H">the full audio roundtable</a> and then watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXHAxVqAb4oJAnbpkPHT96VJO5wHsJF4H">the rest of the symposium</a>.</p>

		<center><span class="post-date">10 February 2014</span></center>
		  <div class="content"><p>Over the last few weeks I’ve gotten a lot of positive feedback and suggestions for <a href="http://craigeley.com/post/72565974459/sifttter-an-ifttt-to-day-one-logger">Sifttter</a>, my DiY-via-<a href="https://twitter.com/ttscoff">@ttscoff</a> automated system to create Day One entries. And it has also taken on a life of it’s own: there are now lots of new recipes that people have built to supplement my original handful, and you can find them all in one place by <a href="https://ifttt.comecipes/search?q=sifttter&amp;ac=false">searching IFTTT for Sifttter</a>. You can now bring Facebook, Github, Jawbone, Pocket, Instagram, and a few others into your daily logs.</p>

<p>Of course, there will always be gaps in a system like this, and, in my experience, once you start logging you want to log more. So people have been asking about ways to easily enter items into the system manually. I think there are three really convenient ways to do this, two for your phone (which I almost always have with me) and one for your desktop.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Via Text</strong>: The first is to simply send IFTTT a text message. The beauty of this is that it’s platform neutral, and even works with “dumb” phones. This recipe should get you started:</li>

" /></a></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Via Drafts</strong>: If you are on iOS, <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmullins">@johnmullins</a> came up with an elegant solution using the Dropbox Actions feature of <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a>. To get this going, start by creating a new Dropbox Actions in Settings. Point the Path option to your Sifttter folder, choose a “Predefined” file, and name it whatever you like. Then, in the code section, you should write <code>- [[date|%B %d, %Y at %I%M%p]] - [[draft]] @done</code> followed by a hard return. Here is what it should look like when you are all said and done:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="http://d.pr/zBjV+" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Via Alfred</strong>: If you’re using <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> (and if you use a Mac, you should be), then you can create entries directly via a few keystrokes. I’ve just slightly modified a workflow created by the people who make Drafts designed to mimic the “Append to Dropbox” action as seen in #2. Read about it on their website <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/blog/2013/03/27/mimic-drafts-append-to-dropbox-using-alfred-on-a-mac/">here</a>, and then download my modified copy here:</li>

		<h1><a href="/01-29-2014/cleaning-up-markdown-footnotes">Cleaning Up Markdown Footnotes</a></h1>
		<center><span class="post-date">29 January 2014</span></center>
		  <div class="content"><p>Just a quick update to an <a href="/post/46089397285/the-digital-dissertator-markdown-footnote-update">old post</a> on Markdown footnotes.</p>

<p>I do all of my writing in Markdown, from these blog posts to <a href="/post/72447244823ew-in-print-making-them-talk-animals-sound-and">academic papers</a>. As I’ve <a href="/post/45896860184/the-digital-dissertator-academic-writing-and">written before</a>, one of the trickiest things I find about academic writing in Markdown is footnoting. My solution—outlined <a href="/post/46089397285/the-digital-dissertator-markdown-footnote-update">here</a>—is to use <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a> to create timestamps and then page down to post them at the bottom. It works great, except for the fact that to engage the snippet (in my case “;ffn”) you have to leave a space after the end of the sentence, thus creating a gap before your footnotes.</p>

<p>To clean all of those up in one fell swoop, I wrote a super simple service that will do it for you using <code>sed</code> and <code>grep</code> searching. You can download it <a href="http://d.prToW">here</a>.</p>

<p>Even more interestingly, I learned that <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/">MMD4</a>—which is included by default in <a href="http://!g" title="Marked2 app">Marked 2</a>—features a new syntax for inline footnoting: simply adding <code>[^text to be footnoted]</code> to the end of a sentence. I can see this being super useful for certain short-form projects, though I still like to look at all my links at the bottom to see if a sources has been cited multiple times, <em>ibid</em> usage, etc.</p>

		<h1><a href="/01-27-2014/the-inspiration-for-the-desktop-computer-the-telephone">The Inspiration for the Desktop Computer? The Telephone</a></h1>
		<center><span class="post-date">27 January 2014</span></center>
		  <div class="content"><p>In his <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/MP3/">recent book</a> on the history of the mp3, Jonathan Sterne argues that sound technologies—especially the telephone—played a critical role in the development of digital technologies. Telephony is “central” to digital history, he writes, “as an industry, as a set of practices, as an aesthetic field, and as a medium.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> He goes on to explain how the telephonic research impacted sound recording:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each major technical iteration of sound recording made use of telephone research: the first phonographs were built in labs funded by telephonic (and telegraphic) research; the first electrical recording and playback technologies were borrowed from innovations in telephone systems in the 1920s; and digital audio recording and playback also used concepts that emerged from AT&amp;T’s research wing, Bell Labs, beginning in the 1920s.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This weekend, I was surprised to learn that the idea of the telephone was also central to the development of the desktop computer. On Saturday, <em>Time</em> magazine debuted a <a href="http://techland.time.com/2014/01/25/steve-jobs-mac/">previously unseen video</a> of Steve Jobs introducing the Macintosh to the Boston Computer Society on January 30, 1984. In it, Jobs explicitly says that the idea for a desktop computer was inspired by the telephone. Around the 12-minute mark of the vide, Jobs says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We look at the telephone and we’re really impressed with the telephone, because it was the first and really the only desk appliance. To be a desk appliance you have to do something really useful, and you have to be really easy to use so people don’t have to spend a lot of time learning how to use this thing, and you have to be really cheap. We don’t think there has been a desk appliance since the telephone. And what we want to is make Macintosh the second desk appliance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the article that accompanies the video, <a href="https://twitter.com/harrymccracken">Harry McCracken</a> notes that this is a metaphor that Jobs expanded upon in a later interview with <em>Playboy</em>, comparing IBM to the telegraph and the Mac to the telephone:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The telephone] was a breakthrough, because people already knew how to use it. It performed the same basic function [as the telegraph], but with radical ease of use. And in addition to just letting you type in the words or click in the words, it let you sing. It let you intone your sentences to really get your meaning across.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>McCracken somewhat dismissively labels these statements “hyper-dramatic” and “self-serving,” but I think they point to the deep relationship between sound and digital technologies—a relationship that perhaps goes even deeper than we thought.</p>

		<h1><a href="/01-17-2014/new-sites-and-new-sounds">New Sites and New Sounds</a></h1>
		<center><span class="post-date">17 January 2014</span></center>
		  <div class="content"><p>After all of the great feedback generated by my <a href="http://craigeley.com/post/72565974459/sifttter-an-ifttt-to-day-one-logger">last post</a>—a Ruby script that automatically logs <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> data into <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a>—I’ve honestly been a little reluctant to get back to the “main” aspect of this blog, which is my academic work. But here we are.</p>

<p>This week I started teaching my experimental undergraduate class, “The Nature of Sound / The Sound of Nature,” which so far has proven to be incredibly cool. For starters, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/jenterysayers">@jenterysayers</a>, I built my <a href="http://craigeley.github.io/297c/">course website</a> using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, a robust and flexible way to host to static website. I’m adding new pages, links, and elements practically every day right now to adjust to the flow of the class the flow of my pedagogical inspiration—which is super high right now. It feels great to be back in the classroom after a few semesters off from teaching. Basically, the course website functions as an interactive syllabus. Nothing is password protected, so you can have a look around and even follow along, to a certain extent. I’ll try to add class notes and slideshows, when appropriate.</p>

<p>Doing all of that tinkering made me think it was time for a change on this site as well. I moved away from the <a href="http://quitebig.tumblr.com/">Quite Big</a> Tumblr theme, which I actually loved, over to the <a href="http://write-theme.tumblr.com/">Write theme</a> just for a change of pace. After my initial excitement I actually found much in the theme that I either disliked (page width, header size) or was fundamentally broken (block quotes), so I spent a few hours tinkering around with it, and that’s what you see here. If you view the posts via <a href="http://craigeley.com/rss">RSS</a> or the Tumblr dashboard, come on over to the <a href="http://craigeley.com">main page</a> sometime and have a look.</p>

<p>Finally, for all of you American Studies / Sound Studies / American West nerds out there—and the handful of us who might exist at that intersection—here’s a head’s up that there is, in fact, an audio version of the “frontier thesis” by <a href="http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/people/s_z/turner.htm">Frederick Jackson Turner</a>. It’s still in print, in fact, and available from—who else?—Smithsonian Folkways. Have a look and a listen <a href="http://www.folkways.si.edu/american-essays-read-by-houston-peterson/prose/album/smithsonian">right here</a>. I’ll be doing a more in-depth post about the audio version of this classic text some time before the end of the semester.</p>

		<h1><a href="/01-07-2014/sifttter-an-ifttt-to-day-one-logger">Sifttter: An IFTTT to Day One Logger</a></h1>
		<center><span class="post-date">07 January 2014</span></center>
		  <div class="content"><p>Let me just start by saying that this project is wholly derived from the work of <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a>. Ever since I saw his script to <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2012/02/25/automating-taskpaper-to-day-one-logs/">log Taskpaper entries to Day One</a>, I’ve been obsessed with finding ways to capture and automate my own information into a daily journal. These experiments were my first attempts at “coding,” and you can see some of that work <a href="http://craigeley.com/tagged/logging">here</a>. When <a href="http://ttscoff.github.io/Slogger/">Slogger 2</a> came out, I was over the moon, and for many months I had it running every night on my machine and churning out entries.</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/craigeley/8301817">Sifttter</a> takes the concept of Slogger and applies it to <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> by using Brett’s original TaskPaper script. Though it is essentially limited to current IFTTT channels, there is lots of flexibility through IFTTT itself, as well as the opportunity for individual input and customization. I’ve been using this for several months, and am happy to share it here for those who might be interested.</p>

<h3 id="set-up">Set-up</h3>

<p>For this to work you will need a copy of <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a>, an <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> account, and a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> account. The script works by reading files generated by IFTTT and sent to a specific folder in your Dropbox. To get you started, here are the recipes that I’m currently using, and how they are configured.</p>

<h3 id="explanation-and-customization">Explanation and Customization</h3>

<p>As you can see when you look at the script or at the IFTTT recipes, the script works by reading lines that start with a dash and today’s date and end with the mark “@done”. The hyphen is there because it creates a nice bulleted list in Day One, and the done tag is a holdover from Brett’s original TaskPaper usage. In this context both of those things still make sense, though, for logging entries on your own, via TaskPaper or any other text editor. For example, if you set up a TextExpander snippet like this one <code>- %B %d, %Y at %I:%M%p - %| @done</code>, you can manually enter a task on your phone or computer. Also, I’ve found that working with the text fields in IFTTT is easier than working with the config file for Slogger, so changing how something is worded or appears in your actual entry is as simple as changing it in the recipe. <strong>Fair Warning</strong>: you <em>must</em> keep the the date at the beginning and the @done at the end so that the script will read the line.</p>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

<p>Once you have your channels configured, just download the <a href="https://gist.github.com/craigeley/8301817">script</a> and make it executable using <code>chmod a+x</code> in the Terminal. Then use an app like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lingon-3/id450201424?mt=12">Lingon</a> to set it to run every night at 11:55pm or so.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>Above you can see the entry from my birthday, which I spent in Nashville with some friends. It was a really great day—food, drinks, shopping, music, art. And, if you read between the lines a little bit, you’ll notice that the awesome wait staff at <a href="http://www.hollandhousebarandrefuge.com/">Holland House</a> let me play my own tunes for a while through the system.</p>

<p><img src="http://d.pr/835H+" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is yesterday’s example, which is heavily redacted to protect the innocent, but I wanted to use it because it nicely demonstrates the Reminders channel. The “Fitness” category comes directly from the Withings Channel, while Tweets obviously comes from Twitter. But “Academic,” “Job Search,” and “Productivity” are all names of lists that I use within the Reminders app. So those get split into individual categories for the purposes of the logbook.</p>

<p>This is really only tested on my machine, but I’ll do my best to answer any questions you might have when trying it out. You can reach me on this Tumblr, of course, or via <a href="https://twitter.com/craigeley">Twitter</a> or email: craigeley AT gmail DOT com.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: If you are still on Mac OS 10.8 or below, please use <a href="https://gist.github.com/craigeley/8322805">this script</a></p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: There was a bug in the script for people using iCloud—the file path was incorrect. (HUGE thanks to Oscar for pointing that out!) Both of the scripts have been updated as of 4:25EST on Jan. 8.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3</strong>: You can now run Sifttter over specific dates and ranges. See <a href="http://craigeley.com/post/77908985251/sifttter-update-the-date-update">this post</a> for more details.</p>

		<center><span class="post-date">16 December 2013</span></center>
		  <div class="content"><p>From <a href="http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/aesthetics-art-audio-field-recording/">Aesthetics and the Art of Audio Field Recording</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When listening to sounds we can choose to focus on the perceptual qualities of the sounds, or on the meanings that the sounds convey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the hardest things about teaching a class on sound is establishing how to talk about it. My course next semester, <em>The Nature of Sound / The Sound of Nature</em>, is designed to explore the relationships between human hearing, sound technologies, and the idea of “nature” from the late nineteenth century to the present. While I’m excited that both the English and Music departments here at Penn State have decided to cross-list the course, I’m also concerned that students coming from one of those areas might not have a lot of experience talking to people coming from the other. I think one of my tasks right from the beginning will be to help develop a shared language for both the “close listening” of sounds and the “close reading” of texts.</p>

<p>One of the problems is that the majority of contemporary nature sound practices—from the scientific project of acoustic ecology to the informal communities of sound artists and advocates—have been slow to explicitly develop their own language or working set of principles. In fact, as <a href="http://soundthoughts1.wordpress.com/2013/05/30/conclusion-1-hunting-for-sound-in-nature/">Caleb Kelly</a> has been pointing out on his blog, most field recording practices are woefully under-theorized. One of the goals of this class, and of my larger work in general, is to put some of these practices into deeper intellectual and historical contexts.</p>

<p>I recently came across <a href="http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/aesthetics-art-audio-field-recording/">this article</a> that attempts to bridge some of these divides by proposing a set of qualities by which we can start to establish an aesthetics of field recording: perspective, density, texture, and motion. While I’m not sure that these are perfect, I think they are an interesting starting point, and I’m thinking about using that article’s many examples in class to see how my students might respond.</p>

<p>I’m in the process of developing a website for the course where some of these issues will hopefully play out in a public way. I’ll post a link and more information once I sort out all of those details in January.</p>

		<h1><a href="/12-12-2013/h-net-ifttt">H-Net + IFTTT</a></h1>
		<center><span class="post-date">12 December 2013</span></center>
		  <div class="content"><p>Those of you on the academic scene are almost certainly familiar with <a href="https://www.h-net.org/">H-Net</a>, the online portal for all things humanities and social sciences. Now, H-Net has rolled out version 2.0, <a href="https:/etworks.h-net.org/">the H-Net Commons</a>, which, among many other improvements, adds RSS feeds to any of the <a href="https:/etworks.h-net.orgetworks">current networks</a>. This means you no longer need to subscribe to an email listserv to find information (or tediously browse an online listserv archive), but instead can use your RSS readers of choice. (Mine happen to be <a href="http:/eadkitapp.com/">ReadKit</a> on my laptop, and <a href="http:/eederapp.com/ios/">Reeder</a> on my phone.)</p>

<p>But perhaps the best part about this is that you now scan these RSS feeds using <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> and send specific entries to certain places. If, like me, you’re interested in American Studies, you might want all CFPs to be added to your iOS Reminders, <a href="https://ifttt.comecipes/133116">like so</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/133116-add-h-amstdy-calls-for-papers-to-your-ios-reminders" target="_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_51" id="embed_recipe-133116"><img src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/133116" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Add H-AMSTDY Calls for Papers to your iOS Reminders connects feed to ios-reminders" width="370px" style="max-width:100%" /></a><script async="" type="text/javascript" src="//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script></p>

<p>Or you could also have all of the weekly Job Update posts go right to your inbox—even if you aren’t subscribed to receive emails—using <a href="https://ifttt.comecipes/133105">this recipe</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/133105-get-an-email-with-the-h-amstdy-weekly-job-guide" target="_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_47" id="embed_recipe-133105"><img src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/133105" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Get an email with the H-AMSTDY weekly job guide connects feed to email" width="370px" style="max-width:100%" /></a><script async="" type="text/javascript" src="//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script></p>

<p>These are untested, and just a few examples that I came up with off the top of my head. Obviously, you could change the feeds and use these with any subject area in the H-Net network. Anyone else using IFTTT with H-Net yet? How is it going?</p>
