title: |- If you are in State College today, a reminder that I’m giving a talk this afternoon on the history of environmental sound recordings at the Palmer Art Museum at 4:00. I’m really excited to discuss some old sounds and the new research I’ve been able to do this year thanks to this appointment. I really can’t say enough how grateful I am to Michael Bérubé and the rest of the IAH staff and fellows. In case you’re wondering about that old fellow up there, it’s Nelson R. Wood, my favorite taxidermist and animal imitator.
