On Friday, the *Wall Street Journal* [published an excerpt](http://d.pr/Udzx) from Yukari Kane’s new book *Haunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs*, and throughout the piece I was struck by how much of Tim Cook’s command over his employees was in fact a command over his own voice and the auditory dynamics of the meeting. I think there is something uniquely audacious and disarming about asking the *exact same question* 10 times in a row.

But he also used silence aggressively. From later in the article:

> When someone was unable to answer a question, Cook would sit without a > word while people stared at the table and shifted in their seats. The > silence would be so intense and uncomfortable that everyone in the > room wanted to back away.

My first reaction to this piece wasn’t to consider theories of listening and the voice, but to think about how innocuous most of our verbal/auditory encounters are in academic life. The portrayal of these meetings reminded me of some particularly tricky grad school rites of passage, but not in a bad way. It can be really productive to get grilled, but it also feels deeply personal—almost intrusive—which is why I think we tend to restrict it to our closest colleagues and/or use it as a weapon on outsiders (job talks, disciplinary policing, etc.)

That said, Cook’s questions are good ones to ask. I had a committee member sit me down once to extoll the virtues asking yourself “so what?”—not in the often-cliché way that we talk about that process, but on a deeper, fundamental level. “What do you mean?” “Why are you not making that clear?” I left that meeting with a sense of twin responsibilities that I’ve carried with me since: 1) generating new scholarship, and 2) making that scholarship understandable and meaningful to experts outside of your particular disciplinary sub-niche. I know I’ll never get asked the same question ten times in a row, but hopefully I’ve already asked myself many more times than that.
