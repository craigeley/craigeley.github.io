It’s hard to believe that it is already December 2nd—my November went by in a really productive and exciting whirlwind of friends, family, and academic conferences. And it’s not slowing down just yet: this weekend I’m heading to Boston for the [New Media in American Literary History Symposium](http://www.northeastern.eduulabmalh/). But before I get to that, I wanted to do a recap of some of the digital humanities work I saw on display at the American Studies Association annual meeting.

I was lucky enough to be a part of one really great panel: the “Digital Humanities Lightning Shorts,” which consisted of 5 minute talks—enforced by someone ringing a decidedly analog bell—highlighting DH projects in various stages of development and implementation. While a few speakers read from traditional papers that engaged with DH themes (not a bad thing!), many other people presented projects that were already online. I took notes and scrawled down a bunch of URLs, so I thought I would post them here for those of you who might be interested. As for the project I’m working on—an interactive history of the sonic boom tentatively titled “Boomscape”—well, more on that at a later date.

-   The first presentation of the day was on [Scalar](http://scalar.usc.edu/), a new digital platform for academic work. I had heard about this project for years, and was thrilled when it finally made it into public beta. I’ve only dabbled in it so far, but it’s clear that it is a powerful tool for the presentation and distribution of scholarly work. Even though they traffic heavily in print metaphors—new projects are called “books,” for example—the software itself is set up to be collaborative, nonlinear, tagged, visualized, etc. I’m thinking about incorporating it into my class this spring.

-   The [Chicago LGBTQ History Project](http://uchicagolgbtqhistoryproject.tumblr.com/) uses the same platform we’re on right now—Tumblr—in order to, in their words, “document the experiences of LGBTQ individuals and communities at the University from the early twentieth century through the present day.” The project actually hasn’t had any posts for a while, but they are working on getting some oral histories digitized and online, among other things.

-   The [Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project](https://www.stanford.edu/group/chineserailroad/cgi-bin/wordpress/) is run out of Stanford, and, much like the above project, is a great example of how digital work can literally make audible and visible aspects of our past that have been erased and/or forgotten. When Shelley Fisher Fishkin presented on this, she had an abundance of moving stories about how this work has connected people to history and to each other.

-   The [Poetastic](http://www.poetastic.com/transmission.html) project is one of those deceptively simple things that is not only super cool, but also emotionally and politically powerful. It’s “just” videos of people reading poetry, but when you navigate around the site and watch some, it feels like something more. I wrote in my notebook, “MUST upload something to this soon.” I haven’t done it yet, but I’m going to.

-   There were several projects that were built on or within the WordPress platform, such as [Songs Without Words](http://songswithoutwords.org/), a digital exhibit of anti-lynching editorial cartoons and illustrations that were published in African American newspapers. The project developed when Amanda Frisken was unsatisfied with the production limitations of presenting the images in an academic print journal, even with very high resolution versions. This project digitizes and annotates images as well as provides lots of searchable metadata.

-   [CommentPress](http://futureofthebook.org/commentpress/) is a plugin system for WordPress blogs that allows students and instructors to annotate a text online. Unlike traditional, at-the-bottom comments, CommentPress comments are paragraph specific and shown alongside the text they annotate. The [Digital Humanities Keywords](http://www.dhkeywords.org/wp/) website is a project that already uses it, and it is also being used by some of the online classes offered by the [FemTechNet](http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/) collective.

-   One of the more robust and interactive tools that I saw was the [Photogrammar](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/map/) project at Yale University, which adds an insane amount of metadata to WPA photos. You can search by location, data, photograher name, subject matter, and color (!), to name just a few. Super robust tool.

-   Also: hardware! In one of the final presentations of the session we heard about the [Lungs project](http://pollutionsensordesign.wordpress.com/), which uses Arduino devices to measure local air quality. This project strikes me as existing at a very cool intersection between DiY hardware/software development and environmental history/justice—two things that could certainly each benefit each other.
