Great anecdote on sound from [Cold Splinters](http://www.coldsplinters.com/2013/10/more-barn/) this morning: it turns out that the first time Graham Nash heard Neil Young’s [*Harvest*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7jeb_D08XA) was on a rowboat in a lake in the middle of Young’s property:

> He has his entire house as the left speaker and his entire barn as the > right speaker. And I heard “Harvest” coming out of these two > incredibly large loud speakers louder than hell. It was unbelievable. > Elliot Mazer, who produced Neil, produced “Harvest,” came down to the > shore of the lake and he shouted out to Neil: How was that, Neil? > > And I swear to god, Neil Young shouted back: More barn!
