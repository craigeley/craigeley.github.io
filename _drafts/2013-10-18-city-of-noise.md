Came across this article today via Barry Truax on the Acoustic Ecology listserv. The written content isn’t especially notable—one of the many “the world is getting louder” pieces—but the research, maps, and graphs are really well done and reveal an interesting fact: the majority of urban noise complaints aren’t from technological ambient sounds (traffic, construction), but from the sounds that humans make. The two largest complaints by far are “music” and “shouting,” with construction noise coming in a distant third.
