Last week I had the opportunity to attend the [New Media in American Literary History Symposium](http://www.northeastern.eduulabmalh/) (hashtag [\#nmalh](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nmalh&src=typd&f=realtime)), where many of the projects and conversations engaged with notions of “the old” and “the new” as they historically relate to media production and consumption. Mary Caton Lingold’s ["sonic dictionary" project](http://today.duke.edu/2013/11/soundsofsouth) strikes me as something that would have fit in nicely at the conference as an example of how some of the longest-held fantasies about sound recording—”the captivity of all manner of sound-waves heretofore designated as ‘fugitive’”^[1](#fn:p69531112013-1)^—can be enacted in a decentered and collaborative way via “new” media technologies. I’ve been lucky enough to virtually “meet” Mary Caton through the [SoundBox Project](http://sites.fhi.duke.edu/soundbox/) at Duke, and reading about her work here has given me a bunch of ideas for assignments I would like to try out in my class on “The Nature of Sound / The Sound of Nature.”

Not unrelatedly, this item came across my desk via my good friend [Brian Johannesen](http://brianjohannesen.com/), who makes some sweet Southern sounds [of his own](http://brianjohannesen.bandcamp.com/).
