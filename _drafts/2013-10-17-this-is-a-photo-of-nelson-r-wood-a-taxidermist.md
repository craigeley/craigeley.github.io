title: This is a photo of Nelson R. Wood, a taxidermist for the Smithsonian and also an animal imitator. He appears briefly in my dissertation, but I’m hoping to write more about him—and the relationship between animal imitation, sound recording and taxidermy more broadly—in the next few months. I came across this photo from Shorpy’s while preparing for my talk at SLSA two weeks ago. That was a great conference, by the way—met some new people, heard some good work, and drank at a great dive bar.
