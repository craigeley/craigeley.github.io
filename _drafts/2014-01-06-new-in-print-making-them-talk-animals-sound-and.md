In case you missed it over the holidays, the new issue of *Antennae: The Journal of Nature in Visual Culture* launched at the end of December, featuring my essay “‘Making them Talk’: Animals, Sound, and Museums.” It’s a much shortened and revised portion of my dissertation that examines (as the title suggests) how sound recordings were incorporated into museum displays. What I’m really trying to get at, though (to varying degrees of success), is how environmental recordings always existed at the intersections between popular entertainment (music and film sound practices), archival preservation (taxidermy, ethnographic recording), and education (museum work). I think there is a lot more to be done in this area, and, well, that’s one of the many threads I’m working on in the book proposal right now.

You can find the essay in its full context on the [Antennae homepage](http://www.antennae.org.uk/), but for convenience I’ve also embedded it below and provided a link for a direct PDF download [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sboz7hy9c93ssif/Eley%20-%20Making%20Them%20Talk.pdf). I would love to hear any comments or feedback via this blog, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/craigeley), or email (cwe1 AT psu DOT edu).
