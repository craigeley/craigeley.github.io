fieldnoise03: into the wind ---------------------------

When this mix was originally posted on April 13, 2011, I didn’t have a whole lot to say about it, and I really don’t now, either. In retrospect, it does seem to mark a shift in the series in terms of the theme—it feels more expansive than some of the others, and the two after this go in even more interesting directions. This mix is also a more “dated” than the others, in that it starts with a semi-viral video star. But it ends with the venerable Brian Eno, so I think everything is kept in balance. Check out the other mixes in the series [here](/tagged/mixtapes).

**fieldnoise mix 03: into the wind** by craig eley (30:42)\ *originally posted April 13, 2011*

**1. nocommonera/Tyler Tubbs :: Porch Wind Storm/Tornado in Hempfield** :: (0:00 – 2:57) :: Tyler Tubbs, age 15, recently became a mild internet sensation for taking a phone call from his mother while videoing a tornado, and narrating it all in a glorious [Pittsburgh accent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_English). As a native Pittsburgher, I wanted to celebrate him here, especially because it worked so nicely with the theme. I captured the audio from the original [YouTube vid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIGMKJ0nSnA), and paired it with a freesound[recording](http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=115533) of a storm.

**2. Ge Gan Ru :: Yi Feng (Ancient Wind) for solo cello (excerpt)** :: (2:57 – 6:13) :: This is from [Tellus \#19](http://www.ubu.com/sound/tellus_19.html), which featured new music from China.

**3. Harry Partch :: Cloud Chamber Bowls** :: (6:13 – 7:09) :: On the 3-vinyl [edition](http://www.discogs.com/Harry-Partch-Delusion-Of-The-Fury-A-Ritual-Of-Dream-And-Delusionelease/1438859) of *Delusion of the Furies*, there is a bonus record of Partch explaining each of his custom instruments and then playing them. I cut his narration here, but if I would have left it you would’ve learned that the “bowls” are actually the tops and bottoms of 12 gallon [carboys](http://www.calpaclab.com/images/products/cg-8108-12.jpg) that Partch acquired from a lab at Berkeley.

**4. Emory Cook :: Ionosphere (excerpt)** :: 7:09 – 8:33 :: [Emory Cook](http://www.folklife.si.edu/archives_resources/collections/cook.aspx) was a pioneer in stereo sound recording, and his Cook Laboratories label releases can fetch big bucks among a certain set of collectors. He was deeply enmeshed in the 1950s hi-fi culture that valued sound for the sake of sound, and here he took recordings of the electricity in the atmosphere, a practice now known as VLF radio. The left and rights channels of this recording feature totally different audio, by the way. Listen for it in your headphones.

**5. The Ghost Orchid :: Aircraft Intercept** :: (8:33 – 9:00) :: I’m not even going to get into a discussion about [EVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voice_phenomenon) here, but this record, *The Ghost Orchid*, is a genuine classic—it’s in its 3rd pressing, I believe, but is also now available as a digital [download](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-EVP-Ghost-Orchid/dp/B0000274TTef=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1302639794&sr=8-3).

**6. David Garland :: No More Misty Night Sky…** :: (9:00 – 11:32) :: This is from [Tellus \#2](http://www.ubu.com/sound/tellus_2.html), which is probably my personal favorite of the series.

**7. James Whitehead :: Air Attack Over Kabul Airfield** :: (11:32-15:42) :: My continued research on the history of the sonic boom has had me thinking about the sounds of war, which has been the subject of a lot of research, including this [recent book](http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?tid=11890&ttype=2). Note: this track gets very loud.

**8. Tony Scott :: A Quivering Leaf, Ask the Winds** :: (15:42 – 18:08) :: This is from Scott’s 1964 album, *Music for Zen Meditation*, often called the first New Age album. I’m playing on the sonic juxtaposition with the track before it here, but I think it works.

**9. Thai Elephant Orchestra :: Ken’s Wind Instrument** :: (18:08 – 20:45) :: Yes, it’s a “band” made up of elephants playing giant “instruments.” [Obviously](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/16/arts/think-tank-a-band-with-a-lot-more-to-offer-than-talented-trumpeters.html).

**10. Wind Farm :: Theme from a Documentary about Jet Skis (live) (excerpt)** :: (20:45 – 25:41) :: Wind Farm is (was?) an Iowa City band featuring [Chad Vollrath](https://twitter.com/chadvollrath), [A.C. Hawley](https://twitter.com/acethoughts), and [Kyle Stein](https://twitter.com/kjstine). What started off as a kind of conceptual/installation art project featuring countless numbers of cassette decks has matured into one of the best noise bands in a town lousy with them. This was from an old live show; the entire set is available for download [here](http://littlevillagemag.com/content/2011/03/21/englert-live-3192011-live-recordings/).

**11. Brian Eno :: Unfamiliar Wind (Leeks Hills)** :: (25:41 – 30:42) :: Eno forever.
