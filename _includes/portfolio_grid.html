In 2015, I gathered all the content I could recover from old WordPresses and Tumblrs and divided it into two separate Jekyll sites. As of 2016, these sites have been retired. The links below show them as they have been archived on the Wayback Machine. You can find more current writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@craigeley" target="_blank">Medium</a>.</h3>
