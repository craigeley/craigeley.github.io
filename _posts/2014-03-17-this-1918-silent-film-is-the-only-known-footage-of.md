This 1918 silent film is the only known footage of the heath hen, a now-extinct member of the prairie chicken family. The last member of his species died in Martha's Vineyard in 1929, with the _Boston Globe_ commenting, "Scientifically and practically he died many times before his death, for he was mourned with each succeeding season that showed him still surviving, but alone, with no possibility of any kindred company."

This unearthed and digitized footage will be shown this weekend at the [annual Mass Audubon Birders Meeting][1].
