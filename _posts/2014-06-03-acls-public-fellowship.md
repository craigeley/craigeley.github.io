I'm happy to finally announce that I've been named a 2014 [ACLS Public
Fellow](http://www.acls.org/research/publicfellows.aspx?id=7006). For
the next two years, I'll be working with [To the Best of Our
Knowledge](http://ttbook.org), an arts and humanities radio show
produced by [Wisconsin Public Radio](http://www.wpr.org/) and
distributed nationally by [PRI](http://www.pri.org/). If you're a reader
of this blog and haven't heard the show—or haven't checked it on out in
a while—please do. (You can grab the podcasts in iTunes
[here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/pri-to-best-our-knowledge/id471896367?mt=2).)
Each hour-long show explores a theme through in-depth interviews as well
as some shorter segments.

Over the last year or so, the producers of the program have been
["rethinking the show from top to
bottom"](http://www.current.org/2014/04/to-the-best-of-our-knowledge-a-weekend-staple-from-wisconsin-gets-makeover/),
and I'm excited to jump in and be a part of that process in my role as
digital producer. I'll be mostly working on online and other
non-broadcast projects to start, so keep your eyes on this space and the
[TTBOOK website](http://ttbook.org) for more details as they unfold. I
officially start in September.

As excited as I am for this new opportunity, I'm equally sad to be
leaving Penn State and the [IAH](http://iah.psu.edu/), which has been an
incredibly supportive home for the last year. This will always be the
place that gave me my first job, and I'll forever be grateful to
[Michael Bérubé](https://twitter.com/MichaelBerube1) and [Hester
Blum](https://twitter.com/HesterBlum) and all of the great people I've
met here in State College.
