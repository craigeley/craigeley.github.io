If you are in State College today, a reminder that I'm giving a talk this afternoon on the history of environmental sound recordings at the Palmer Art Museum at 4:00. I'm really excited to discuss some old sounds and the new research I've been able to do this year thanks to this appointment. I really can't say enough how grateful I am to [Michael Bérubé][1] and the rest of the IAH staff and fellows.

In case you're wondering about that old fellow up there, it's [Nelson R. Wood][2], my favorite taxidermist and animal imitator.
