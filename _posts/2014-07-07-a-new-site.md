It's always a combination of exactly two things that make me want to update my website: 1) the development of a large or small life change, and 2) the desire to procrastinate from a larger and scarier task at hand. In this case, I was thrilled to finally [announce](/06-03-2014/acls-public-fellowship/) that I'll be an [ACLS Public Fellow](https://www.acls.org/research/publicfellows.aspx?id=7006) working on [To the Best of Our Knowledge](http://ttbook.org) starting in September combined with the related fact that I have a ton to do before we move to Madison, both at home and in terms of some writing commitments. With that in mind, I'm planning on moving to this new set-up, which is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), styled by making some slight modifications to [Ian Camporez](https://twitter.com/iancamporez)'s fantastic [Thinny theme](http://camporez.com/blog/thinny-2/), and hosted using [Bluehost Spoke](http://www.bluehost.com/cgi/spoke).

One of the main reasons I was interested in Jekyll is that it is a kind of anti-platform platform—it's really just a Ruby script that generates a static version of your site that you can then host from anywhere. I think anyone considering academic "domain of one's own" initiatives like [this one](http://sites.psu.edu/humanitiesda/a-domain-of-ones-own-at-penn-state/) and [this one](http://umw.domains/)—which are clearly a great idea—also needs to consider what Wanye Marshall has appropriately called ["platform politricks"](http://wayneandwax.com/?p=2913). One of the many lessons there is if you really want a domain of your own, then you need to actually *own* it. In fact, I would love to host this website myself from a computer sitting in my house, but I'm not quite there yet.

A second is reason is that even though there were Tumblr themes that claimed to be [specifically styled for long-form writing](http://write-theme.tumblr.com/), most of Tumblr just doesn't seem to work that way, which made me feel like I was doing it wrong. I think this site can and will function more like a traditional blog, but I still managed to migrate all my previous Tumblr posts over here—and old URLs should (*should*) redirect.

There are still a ton of kinks to work out—and hopefully some new features to add—so if/when you find something broken or wonky or weird, let me know here in the comments (which you can access from the home page with the little chat icon below each post) or hit me up on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/craigeley/).

As always, thanks for reading!
