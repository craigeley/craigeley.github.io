Last week I wrote a post on Alice Waters and the politics of food that [went live over on TTBOOK](http://www.ttbook.org/book/how-political-food) on Thanksgiving. It’s something that’s been stewing since I read [this *New Yorker* article](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/shut-eat) on “foodie culture,” and is essentially a response to it. The post got branded an “essay” somewhere in the chain before it went live, but I think it’s a little short and informal for that; it’s really more akin to something I would post here than a fully fleshed out “essay,” but you get the picture.

I’m hoping to do more pieces like this—both written, and, eventually, audio—and the TTBOOK website gives me a nice platform for doing so. I’m probably not going to post here every time I produce something, but I’ll tag my posts so you can follow along via RSS if you’re so inclined.
