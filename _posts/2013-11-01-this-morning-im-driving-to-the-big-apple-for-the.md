This morning I’m driving to the Big Apple for the New York Metro American Studies Association meeting, where I’m giving a paper tomorrow on whistling and masculinity. If you are in the neighborhood, my talk is at 11am at 1 Pace Plaza, right on the Manhattan side of the Brooklyn Bridge. You can see the full conference schedule here, and follow along with the hashtag `#nymasa`.
