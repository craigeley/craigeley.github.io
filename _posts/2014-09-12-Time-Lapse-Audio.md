Legendary New York recordist Tony Schwartz came up in conversation at work today, and one of my colleagues mentioned "Nancy Grows Up," a time-lapse audio essay documenting the development of his niece. While I consider myself a pretty big Schwartz fan (and a proud owner of a vinyl copy of [*New York 19*](http://instagram.com/p/arYs7dAAu6/?modal=true)), I had never heard this piece. Once I did, I was blown away, and haven't stopped listening since:

Unlike time-lapse video, the sound segments themselves are not sped up, they simply cover a long range of historical timeâ€”in essence making this the female and sonic counterpart to Richard Linklater's *Boyhood*. [Is there a mini essay in that idea?] Anyway, it turns out the piece has been [featured on an episode of Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91585-unlocking-the-secrets-of-time/) (of course!), and has been the subject of [a think piece on media and history](http://theappendix.net/issues/2013/7/nancy-grows-up-the-media-age-and-the-historians-craft). For more info on Schwartz, check out David Suisman's [story in Smithsonian Folkways Magazine](http://www.folkways.si.edu/magazine/2012_fall_winter/cover_story.aspx).
