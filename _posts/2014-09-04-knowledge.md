My first week on the job at [To the Best of Our Knowledge](http://ttbook.org) has been a crash course is seeing how radio gets madeâ€”and it still hasn't lost any of the magic. This morning I sat in as next weekend's show on "dual identities" was mixed. Pictured, left to right: producer Rehman Tungekar, host Anne Strainchamps in the recording booth, and engineer Caryl Owen. You can *just* make me out as a reflection above Anne's head.
