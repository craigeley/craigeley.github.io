Yesterday I gave a short presentation on my work to a group of undergraduate honors students at Penn State, and I mentioned this song but somehow left it out of my presentation slides. I’ve probably posted about it before, but it remains one of my favorites.

Margaret McKee was trained at the Agnes Woodward School of Artistic Whistling in Los Angeles, and was often referred to as “The California Songbird.” I’m pretty sure she graduated from that whistling academy before she actually graduated from high school in 1918. This version of “Invitation Waltz” is labeled as 1921.
