![](http://d.pr/QMi5+)

For those of you in Iowa City (or coming into town for the [Mission Creek Festival](http://www.missionfreak.com)), I'll be giving a talk on Friday on the history of performance whistling and its connection to the environmental politics of bird preservation, as well as its connection to race, class and gender. 4pm in 704 Jefferson Building.
