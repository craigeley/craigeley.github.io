Postcard from Charles M. Bogert to Moe Asch, June 3, 1953. The recordings Bogert collected on this trip were released as _[Sounds of the American Southwest_][1] the following year.

Bogert recorded many minutes of calls, rackets, and noises for Folkways, including the cult classic and personal favorite _[Sounds of North American Frogs_][2].
