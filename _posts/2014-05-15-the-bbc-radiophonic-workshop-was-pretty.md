The BBC Radiophonic Workshop was pretty incredibleâ€”I was turned on to its existence in grad school, right around the time I discovered Pierre Schaeffer and the experimental radio scene in Paris (via [Michel Chion][1]). My curiosity kind of stopped there, though, which is why I was happy to find the above 10-minute documentary. It was produced by The Vinyl Factory, and you can read more about it [here][2].
