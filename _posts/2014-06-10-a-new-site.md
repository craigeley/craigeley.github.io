It's always a combination of exactly two things that make me want to update a website: 1) the development of a large or small life change, and 2) the desire to procrastinate from a larger and more scary task at hand. In this case, it was me finally being able to publicly announce that I'll be working on [To the Best of Our Knowledge](http://ttbook.org) starting in September, and the fact that I have an essay due for a proposed book collection soon. With that in mind, I'm moving to this new set-up, which is powered by Jekyll and run from GitHub. I'll be working on moving my old Tumblr posts into this format sometime over the next few days, once I can figure out how to get certain functions to work a litte better.

As always, thanks for reading.
