It's always a combination of exactly two things that make me want to update my website: 1) the development of a large or small life change, and 2) the desire to procrastinate from a larger and scarier task at hand. In this case, it was me finally being able to publicly announce that I'll be working on [To the Best of Our Knowledge](http://ttbook.org) starting in September combined with the fact that I have an essay due for a proposed book collection soon. With that in mind, I'm planning on moving to this new set-up, which is powered by [Jekyll](!g "Jekyll blog platform"), styled by [Cole Townsend](https://twitter.com/twnsndco)'s [Balzac theme](http://jekyll.gtat.me/about/), and run from [GitHub](!g "GitHub"). There are still a ton of kinks to work out, so in the meantime, the main action will still be over on [Tumblr](http://craigeley.com/).

As always, thanks for reading.
