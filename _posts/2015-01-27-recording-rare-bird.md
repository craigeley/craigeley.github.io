I’ve been obsessed with this sound for a long time: [a 1935 recording of an ivory-billed woodpecker](http://macaulaylibrary.org/audio/6784). I’ve written about it, given presentations on it, and listened to it more times than I can count. So it feels right that it became the subject of my first broadcast radio essay. Since I started at To the Best of Our Knowledge, I’ve been wanting to do some segments that discuss historical sound recordings, so when Steve Paulson told me he was doing a show on extinction, this seemed like a perfect fit. Hopefully it will be the first of many. For more information on the expedition and this story, I did a brief write-up [here](http://www.ttbook.org/book/recording-americas-rarest-bird). And because I’m a recovering academic it even includes a bibliography.

Some nerdy notes on the recording process: [Joe Hardke](https://soundcloud.com/joe-hardtke), a great sound designer at WPR, does the voice of Jim Tanner. It was his idea to run the vocals through a tape machine, but I brazenly thought I could EQ them myself and make them sound “old.” Unsurprisingly, I was wrong and Joe was right. Caryl Owen ran Joe’s vocal tracks out to a reel-to-reel at pretty low volume, then boosted them on the way back in to the computer to get that nice, warm tape hiss. She also did a killer job lightly treating the historical audio material, which was generously provided by the Macaulay Library at Cornell. The music is from Widowspeak’s [*The Swamp* EP](http://www.capturedtracks.com/shop/_ct-release/ct-189-widowspeak-the-swamps-ep/), except for that last track[...](http://www.npr.org/2005/07/06/4721675/brinkley-ark-embraces-the-lord-god-bird)
