From [soundscraper.org | live crowdsourced soundscaping](http://www.soundscraper.org/):

> Soundscraping — using the Internet to share, play, process, and mix > live sounds from the world at large.

I *love* the idea of real-time soundscape audio streaming on the internet, and I’ve experimented with it before using [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/)—something I hope to do again. (I think Mixlr is seriously underutilized for this purpose.)

The above event happens on March 10 with a call for participation email deadline of TOMORROW. So look over the amazing(ly ugly) website for the relevant details. Could be a cool little event, if a critical mass of people are involved.
