This made the rounds a week ago when it came out, but is worth posting again if you haven’t heard it. It’s a great history of the waveform, from paper to ProTools to machines made with actual human ears (!). Sound historian Jonathan Sterne is featured prominently, and since Sterne edits the reader I’m using in [my class](http://craigeley.github.io/297c/) this semester, I’m planning to play this for my students in a few weeks when we get specifically into this history of recording technologies.
