Back in December, I went to the [New Media in American Literary History Symposium][1] hosted by Northeastern and organized by the seemingly indefatigable [Ryan Cordell][2] and Rhae Lynn Barnes, who runs [US History Scene][3].

Despite "literary" being in the title of the event, there were a handful of us there working on audio, and we were lucky enough to have Lisa Gitelman serve as the moderator and discussant on our panel. The event was live-streamed, but if you missed it then, the good folks at the [NULab][4] have recently posted [all of the sessions][5].

This isn't necessarily my best work, but it is the first time I formally presented on the idea of "natural history media," which has been really helpful as I frame out my current book project (which might be titled *Hearing Natural History*). At this point I'm pretty used to hearing the sound of my own voice, but this video was pretty challenging to get throughâ€”and I probably won't read my notes from my phone in future presentations. Ah well.

Anyway: you can (and should!) see my presentation in the context of [the full audio roundtable][6] and then watch [the rest of the symposium][5].
