My friend Ted Thompson's debut novel came out last week, and I can't believe I have yet to mention it here. For starters, it's a beautifully written and deeply moving portrait of suburban American life. But it also has some serious bite: it''s a novel that asks really timely questions about whether or not it is even possible to live an ethical and satisfying life while working within the financial system. I'm looking forward to teaching it some dayâ€”hopefully in an American studies course, where it would be perfect in a unit on the suburbs, on whiteness and masculinity, or on the financial crisis, among others. Really highly recommended.
