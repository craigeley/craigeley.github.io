> Sound and silence were Thoreau's grand analogy: silence was a celestial sea of eternity, the general, spiritual, and immutable; sound was the particular and momentary bubble on its surface.

â€”Sherman Paul, "The Wise Silence: Sound as the Agency of Correspondence in Thoreau," *The New England Quarterly* 22.4 (1949), 513.
