Announcing: [Sound/Science/Environment](http://sites.psu.edu/soundscienceenvironment2014/)

Over the last several weeks, my colleague [Jonathan Beever](http://www.jonathan.beever.org/) and I have been working on putting together a one-day symposium and workshop for scholars whose work involves “the soundscape,” broadly defined. I’m happy to announce that that event is coming to fruition on Tuesday[^14761158], when a dozen scholars from Penn State and beyond will be coming together for the “Sound / Science / Environment” critical workshop. The event brings together musicologists, composers, psychologists, historians, biologists, tourism scholars, among others. If you are anywhere near Central Pennsylvania, consider joining us for the day! The full schedule, including brief abstracts and bios, is available on [our website](http://sites.psu.edu/soundscienceenvironment2014/).

[^14761158]: I was bummed to see that this is also the [Day of DH](https://digitallab.psu.edu/dhguide/day-of-dhpenn-state/). I hope some Penn State DHers can manage sneak over to a session or come to the keynote that evening.
