I had never heard of [uncube magazine](http://www.uncubemagazine.com/index.html) until their most recent [issue on acoustics](http://www.uncubemagazine.com/magazine-21-12784433.html#!/page1) came across my desk, but I love it: it's a beautiful (if a bit confusing to navigate) combination of words, sounds, and images. Features an article by David Byrne, if you need some enticement.
