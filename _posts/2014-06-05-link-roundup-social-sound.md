Making the rounds this week was [this
aricle](https://medium.com/message/sound-and-memory-168ea6b72c7b) on why
we need “an Instragram for sound,” which reminded me of [this
article](http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2013/12/20/reach-out-and-touch-on-audio-social-media/)
by [Robin James](https://twitter.com/doctaj) on why we probably won’t
get one. And then there was [this
article](http://digg.com/originals/why-audio-never-goes-viral) about why
sound doesn’t go viral in the first place…

I have some thoughts on this which I haven’t fully put together yet, but
by way of personal experience I will say that I used
[Audioboo](https://audioboo.fm/) for about a week before I abandoned it…
