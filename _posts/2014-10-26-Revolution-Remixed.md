Apologies for the "radio silence" (couldn't resist) on this blog as of late, but as you likely know, I have been busy working on [actual radio](http://craigeley.com/09-04-2014/knowledge/). My first two months here at [TTBOOK](http://ttbook.org) have been an exciting and exhausting crash course in the ins and outs of public media. I've been working on digital initiatives large and small, including a ton of content for an upcoming mini-series on death and dying, as well as some more blog-like posts which I'll hopefully be able to show off sooner rather than later.

In the meantime, the staff has also been _very patiently_ working to get me up to speed on audio and broadcast production, and the first piece that I (mostly) edited went live yesterday. It's an interview with none other than movie-star-turned-revolutionary Russell Brand. After making headlines for expressing [his politics of non-voting on British television](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk), he decided to devote a full book to explaining the rationale behind his position on votingâ€”as well as income inequality, meditation, etc. I don't want to editorialize here (something about the ethics of my job?), but in my edits I did my best to accurately depict the tenor and content of the conversation he had with our producer Charles Monroe-Kane. I've embedded the piece below, but you can also have a listen on [the site](http://www.ttbook.org/book/our-minds-russel-brand-revolutionary-politics) or in the [podcast stream](http://www.ttbook.org/book/podcast-rss).
