## HASTAC iPad Workflows- ZotPad-conflict
There has been a lot if interest among this current group of HASTAC on workflow, specifically working with PDFs on an iPad. (See these posts 

Just yesterday, ZotPad 1.2 was released into the iTunes App Store. Though it just shows an incremental build number over its 1.1 predecessor, the app is actually a huge leap forward for people who use Zotero not only as a citation manager, but also a PDF manager. 

Zotero has a lot of nice features, but in my opinion one of the worst is how it handles file attachments: by burying them in oddly-named folders.

The Zotfile plugin allows you to overcome this 

Zotfile plugin is an incredible timesaver, since it is automated processes that I used to do by handâ€”download a file, rename it, and place in a folder with my other research. Basically.

Now, with ZotPad, you can access this information on your tablet and even on your iPhone, with on-demand or automatic file downloads.
