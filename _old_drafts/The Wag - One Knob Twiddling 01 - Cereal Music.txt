One Knob Twiddling: Cereal Music

In 1973, Post Cereals was responsible for one of the most perfect celebrity endorsements of all time: The Jackson 5's appearance in a series of commercials for Alpha Bits. Alpha Bits, you might recall, is a cereal comprised of letters made out of sugar; the Jackson 5 had a sugary sweet hit song named after the first three letters of the alphabet. (In truth, though, "ABC" fits less into to the tradition of "songs about letters" \["C is for Cookie" being the representative example] and more into the tradition of "songs where women are forced to dance for the enjoyment of men" \[of which Wyclef Jean's "Perfect Gentleman" remains the standard]. Shake it, shake it, baby! C'mon now!) In the commercials the J5 riff on "The A.B.C.," more commonly known as "The Alphabet Song," copyrighted in Boston in 1835. The music is actually a classical piece commonly reworked into popular culture—it's origins stretch back to Mozart's piano variations in the 1780s, and it also serves as the basis for "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star." MJ and family reworked it for commercial food sales in the 1970s, when "V" is for vitamins, "D" is for delicious, and everything is underlaid with funk guitar. Watch it [here][1]. 

While maybe not as old as Mozart, the advertising jingle has been around for a long time, and in that context, the Jackson 5/Alpha Bits commercials are mostly interesting as a small slice of Americana. But they got me thinking about the ways we soundtrack our food experiences more generally—not in real life (dare I mention "dinner party music"?), but as seen on TV. In [a very long article][2] for the *New York Times* back in 2009, Michael Pollan addressed his concerns with cooking shows on television, namely that that have stopped being about making food and started being about consuming it, turning cooking "into a spectator sport." He says that cooking makes good television because it has narrative, it has fire, it has attractive textures and rhythms, and it has beautiful people doing it. It also has soundtracks. And those soundtracks are, for the most part, pop songs.

Take Top Chef, one of the best shows on television (cooking or otherwise), whose opening music is a cross between 90's UK electronica (overdriven guitars, industrial sound effects, a soulful female vocal sample) and the 1960s Batman theme ("na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na NA NAH!"). It's customary to including cooking sound effects here, and the [Season 1 introduction][3] gives us plenty of knives and burner flames to work with. The [Season 6 intro][4], which took place in Las Vegas, adds the sound of a roulette wheel, which I think is a nice touch. These soundtracks are, of course, jingles, commercials for their own show as well as products for sale. Harold 'Barefoot' Saunders III composed the Top Chef music, but unlike his soundtrack for Project Runway, it is not available as an album [for sale on the iTunes Store][5].

Top Chef: Masters  provides a variation on the theme, if you will. Composed by Matthew McGaughey, TC:M eschews vocals entirely for a wholly percussive sound in the American songwriting tradition of *Stomp! The Musical.* While synthetic and computerized to the extreme, a generous listener—and one distracted by all of the flashing knives and flaming burners in the opening sequence—might be able to imagine a rock drummer furiously tapping the steering wheel of a car made entirely of garbage can lids. McGaughey's [Myspace page][6] is still up and going, as is the website for his company/songwriting collective/band, ["Serial Musique."][7] 

Wait, what? The name "Serial Musique" implies a connection to two of the more important strands of classical music in the 20th century: "serialism" and "musique concrete." The former was championed by Arthur Schoenberg in the 1920s, the latter by Pierre Schaffer in the 1940s, but the details here aren't especially interesting. What's more interesting (maybe?) is that here we have, like Top Chef itself, a weird connection between high art (haute cuisine, classical music) and the everyday (plain old "eating," television, for-hire working musicians). Perhaps "cereal music" would be more apporpriate? And that's not a dig—eating is pleasurable, it's something we all do, and I think pop music (good or bad) is exactly the way it should be soundtracked.
