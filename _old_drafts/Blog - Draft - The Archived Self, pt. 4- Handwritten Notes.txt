## Draft: The Archived Self, pt. 4: Handwritten Notes

I'm really down with supplementing the data culled by my logbook with handwritten notes. So, this step can be done as analog or as digital as you like. The easy way: a notepad, a pen, and a scanner. Write some notes, and import your notes into Day One. Or just keep your notebooks on the shelf, whatever.

I'm personally into keeping digital notes as well. My app of choice is Notepad, and my stylus of choice is the Jot Pro.
