## Unsilent Night
On Friday I took part in the Iowa City premier of *Unsilent Night*, a 1992 composition by Phil Kline which was organized locally by [Mark Rushton][1] (who posted his thoughts on it [here][2]). The composition is a 4-channel, 45-minute piece designed to be played back on multiple boomboxes while walking around town. Wikipedia calls it a “moving sound sculpture,” but that actually implies something less dynamic than my experience last weekend. (Admittedly, I know nothing about the current state of “sculpture,” it’s theories and practices, etc.) Within the rhetoric of sound studies it felt more like an anti-soundwalk—in a good way—where rather than passively listening to our environment we were actively broadcasting sounds into it.

Anyway, this created some interesting moments, especially in combination with the holiday-themed music. While Kline’s composition is decidedly avant-garde, it relies pretty heavily on familiar Christmastime sonic motifs such as bells, chimes, and choirs. At one point when we were in the quieter Northside neighborhood, it felt like we were carolers. Later, as were were getting strange stares from parents collecting blearly-eyed, post-final exam first-years from their dorms, it felt like a public art project. At other times it felt decidedly cultish. I mean, the music has chanting. A pretty significant amount of chanting.

Adding to that cultish feeling was the fact that the 8 of us participating seemed pretty of unsure how much we were “allowed” to talk during the “performance,” myself included. This was at least partially my fault, as my presence with a recorder and headphones invariably changed the group dynamic. But speaking of that recording, it came out pretty well. You can hear different channels of the composition as I walk among the participants; you can hear that Chad Vollrath is using a old tape deck with a crazy amount of wow and flutter; you can hear passing traffic, me sniffling, etc. After about the 25 minute mark, you can also hear a lot of wind noise, because my muff fell off and I decided that putting it back would have cause even more trouble. So I just went with it. As a technical note, this was recorded using the internal mics of a Tascam DR-40.

Thanks again to Mark for organizing.
