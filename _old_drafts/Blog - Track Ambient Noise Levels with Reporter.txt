## Track Ambient Noise with Reporter

![](http://d.pr/4M1Z+)

As you can tell from my [SIFTTTER projects](http://craigeley.com/tagged/sifttter), I've become borderline obsessed with activity tracking and monitoring my daily activities. I'm still not entirely sure what drives this tendency, but I'm certainly not aloneâ€”new products directed at this impulse arrive almost daily. 

The newest one I've seen is [Reporter][3464-001], a nifty little iPhone app that randomly polls you throughout the day to see what you're up to. I've used it for a few days now, and in my opinion, the best things about these apps continues to be the way that that they can leverage your phone's sensors to pull down information about your location, how many steps you've taken, etc. However, Reporter is the first app I've seen (though I'm sure there are others) that uses your phone's microphone to track ambient noise levels. All the noise-obsessed people in the world rejoice! But it actually is kind of cool, and I'm considering using the app for that feature alone. It also exports nicely to CSV format.

I've actually been working on some of my own scripts that you can use for daily tracking, which I'll do a post about later this week.
