## Civility is Not a Sign of Weakness
Writing about the death of Osama Bin Laden [this morning in the Baltimore Sun][1], University of Maryland professor Rebecca A. Adelman said that with his burial at sea, the United States “finally made him invisible…\[exerting] ultimate control over over how and where bin Laden could appear — power it had been seeking since Sept. 11.” She cites the debate around the 2007 tape “The Solution” as an example, which I also recall as a key moment in the ongoing discussion about Bin Laden’s age, location, and vitality. But still, as Jonathan Sterne has pointed out in his essay “Enemy Voice,” Bin Laden’s image has always been allowed to circulate freely in the Western world.

The photo on the left shows a soldier holding “Ben Laden” mashed up against the American flag…and on the right is me holding my copy of the wallet, which is actually a little worse for the wear. The thing is pretty cheaply made; didn’t hold up too long as an actual wallet.)

Since his image is so widely available, and so publicly scrutinized, according to Sterne the real danger is in Bin Laden’s voice, which is actively suppressed by the media and the government. Unlike the powerful, direct, closely mic’ed speeches we get from our own national leaders, Bin Laden’s voice is recorded on cheap equipment often at some distance, his voice is “reedy” rather than full, his recordings are filled with background noise. Alternately a described as being a “charismatic speaker” or “sending secret messages,” Sterne argues that his voice raises important questions about “Western European and American traditions of mediatic speech.” You can read Sterne’s entire article [here][3] (PDF link) to get a sense of the scope of his argument. It’s a fantastic essay.

There’s an interesting connection between Sterne’s arguments and the slightly different kind of voice suppression that went down this week with Pittsburgh Steelers running back Rashard Mendenhall, who [tweeted his thoughts on Bin Laden’s death][4]. Significantly, the tweet which pissed everyone off made reference to the fact that none of us have actually heard Bin Laden’s voice. He wrote, “What kind of person celebrates death? It’s amazing how people can HATE a man they have never even heard speak. We’ve only heard one side…” It was perhaps the most common sentiment expressed in my own Facebook and Twitter feeds, including the people who were circulating [the “fake” MLK quote][5]. But Mendenhall, in advocating for more than one voice to be heard, was effectively silenced in the press, as reporters avoided asking questions about the content of his statement and chose to reduce the debate to, “Should professional athletes be allowed to have opinions?” I was really disappointed by the usually thoughtful James Walker, who in [this blog post][6] used a combination of “think before you speak” and “keep your thoughts to yourself” logic in order to chide Mendenhall, even though it was presented as a kind of critique of Twitter itself. But this line in particular struck me: “There are plenty of other ways to debate controversial subjects in a less public forum.” How? Where? And why? Is this not an issue that demands our most public forums?

Last Wednesday, to “clarify,” Mendenhall released this statement: ”This controversial statement was something I said in response to the amount of joy I saw in the event of a murder. I don’t believe that this is an issue of politics or American pride; but one of religion, morality, and human ethics.” Unsurprisingly, even with this response, Mendenhall was hung out to dry by both his team and one of his sponsors, who both basically responded with “We support the troops,” as if that answered some sort of question. (It should be mentioned that Mendenhall doesn’t shy away from politics: he’s a 9/11 truther, and once compared the NFL to slavery). But he hasn’t really backed down on Twitter, recently ending tweets with hashtags like #think, #humans, #love, and #freethinkers.

The whole thing reminded me of yet another voice: John F. Kennedy’s, which declared in the inaugural address of 1961 that “civility is not a weakness.” I have a copy of this speech on the record *John F. Kennedy: The Presidential Years*, which is a compilation of many of his famous speeches and addresses, produced by Fox Movietone News in glorious mono. I’ve made it available for your contemplation [here][7].
