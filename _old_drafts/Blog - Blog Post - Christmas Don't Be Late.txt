## Blog Post - Christmas Don't Be Late

No matter what you do or don't celebrate this season, I hope you can find 4 minutes to celebrate [Ross Bagdasarian][1]—aka Dave Seville—who in my mind still does not get nearly enough recognition for his crazy tape manipulation work in the 1950s. (Sadly, this video has been altered with a newer version of the song, but it was the best I could find.)

Whatever your hula hoop is this year, I sure hope you get it. See you in 2014!
