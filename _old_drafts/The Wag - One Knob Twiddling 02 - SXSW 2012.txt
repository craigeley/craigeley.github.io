## The Wag - One Knob Twiddling 02 - SXSW 2012
'You Don't Know My Government', or, Three Bands to Watch from SXSW 2012!

For years the capital city of Texas has embraced the slogan "Keep Austin Weird," but a more appropriate motto for the SXSW music festival might be "Keep Austin Strange." The Oxford English Dictionary defines strange as "belonging to some other place or neighborhood; unknown to the particular locality." This is true for the majority of bands, fans, and industry executives who descend on Austin not only as strangers to the locals but by and large as strangers to each other. However, as Urban Dictionary [helpfully reminds us][1], strangeness can also lead to physical (though not necessarily romantic) intimacy, the desire to have something that does not belong to you: “I need to go out and get some strange tonight.” SXSW is at its absolute best when one engages with the musical strange on all levels. It's a simple recipe: find yourself watching an unfamiliar band, allow yourself be fucked, and try to remember (or forget) the names later.

Sometimes when practicing the musical equivalent of anonymous sex, you comes across a person rapping about anonymous sex. This was my situation when I discovered Rockwell Knuckles on Friday night. I arrived at the club because I had to take a piss; I stayed because the St. Louis MC  had a supremely technical flow, was dressed in the ["black ivy"][2] aesthetic, and had an Asian female DJ named Lilly Vanilli. This guy just oozed style, which makes sense now that I know his new album title is an inverted and more aggressive riff on Heidi Klum's *Project Runway* catchphrase: *You're Fucking Out, I'm Fucking In*. 

But in his short, 4-song set, the standout track was ["Government Name (Spontaneous Lover)"][3] from his 2009 album *The Glow*. My friends and I were immediately drawn to the chorus chant of "she don't know my government," which seemed dense with meaning. Was his lover an anarchist? An undocumented person? Was Rockwell Knuckles' "government" something more personal? His friends perhaps, or his "constitution," or his moral code? In the din of the club, however, we missed a key word: "you don't know my government" is, in the last instance in the chorus, followed by the word "name." Upon further research, I was disappointed to find out that it was simply a rather long way of saying that his sexual partner didn't even know his name. (For another example of this usage, listen to [this track][4] around the 1:20 mark.)

In fact, there were plenty of bands at SXSW who in a literal way didn't "know" *my* government because they were foreign-born. For example, this year's SXSW boasted 7 bands from mainland China, the most in the history of the festival. These bands also represented 7 of the 10 best band names of the event, including one I went to see simply based on their name: Duck Fight Goose. This Shanghai 4-piece shares a musical sensibility with several of the biggest electronic/noise/dance bands of the last decade, including Fuck Buttons, These Are Powers, Ponytail, and Dan Deacon, each of whom were all also well known for their dramatic live shows. Duck Fight Goose didn't bring that level of physicality or theatricality to their stage presence, but it was more than made up for in the music. Frontman Han Han plays a whole mess of gear, and is supported by a female rhythm section and another guy on keys and synth textures. Their live show is reflective of their new album, *Sports*, which features lots of singing in English and could generally be described as "accessible." (You can read a great interview with their manager Brad Ferguson about them and the Shanghai music scene more generally [here][5].)

But perhaps the "strangest" (and most rewarding) musical experience for me last weekend was delivered by another non-American band—Sonido San Francisco, who despite the name, don't have a "San Francisco Sound" like any I've ever heard. From Xonacatlan, the band has a vibe that lands somewhere between Fatboy Slim and more traditional Mexican music. Looking for our next move after seeing !!! improbably turn a venue built to resemble a giant Doritos vending machine seem like a pretty cool place be, my friends and I found a tent on Rainey St. erupting. Imagine [this video][6] come to life. So we danced. Then we walked back to the hotel. And in that hotel, I would guess, a few people were having anonymous sex like we just did.
