One Knob Twiddling: I Can Hear The Heart Beating As One

Dr. James Shaver [had the keenest ear in cardiology][1]. As a teacher at UPMC Medical School, his lectures famously included beat boxing and scat singing the sounds of the human heart, often with the addition of pneumonic devices to help students correctly diagnose rhythmic abnormalities. I first met Dr. Shaver at his househis son John and I first became friends in high school. But only when I came back from college and fell in with a crowd of med students did I hear about his vocal theatrics.  I can still hear a friend of mine laughing and saying "TEN-nes-see, TEN-nes-see, TEN-nes-see" over and over again. I can't remember what "Tennessee" was the diagnosis for.

The stethoscope was invented by Rene-Theophile-Hyacinthe Laennec in 1816, the key instrument in what became known as "mediate auscultation," or the act of listening to the sounds of a patient's body. Sound historian and theorist Jonathan Sterne has argued that the stethoscope was an key instrument in the 19th century development of "audile technique," where listening became "a technical skill." 150 years after the invention of the stethoscope, doctors and students clearly still needed help developing this skill. In 1966, no less than two records of hear sounds were releasedone in English, and one in French. The English one was put out by London Records, and called, appropriately, [*Auscultation of the Heart*][2]. It was recorded by J.B. Barlow and W.A. Pocock, with narration by Stephen O'Reilly. (As an aside, that record label dubbed their hi-fi technology "Imperial f.f.r.r.," which stood for "full frequency range reproduction." *Imperial f.f.r.r* is also the name of my favorite record of the 90s, by the band Unrest.) Side A starts you off with the basics, but things really pick up on Side B, when you get into systolic and diastolic murmurs. My copy has some pops and scratches, but for the curious I put together a download of the album that you can grab [here][3].

It isn't just our own hearts that humans have been interested in listening to. In the 1957 recording *Sound of the Satellites*, put out on Folkways Records, the narrator believes he can hear the heartbeat of Laika (via radio telemetry) as she orbits the Earth inside of Sputnik. As you can hear [here][4]go to the track called "Laika's Heart"the spliced together sounds do suggest a tiny heart beating. But T.A. Benham, who recorded the album, had no way of knowing that Laika was probably already dead.

The sounds of the heart, in a literal sense, have also bled over into popular music, where "the heart" is universal subject matter. My favorite interpretation might be the 1967 hit ["I Think We're Alone Now,"][5] written by Ritchie Cordell and recorded by Tommy James and The Shondells (and then, of course, by Tiffany in the 80s). The narrative of the song sets things up perfectly, as the young couple, trying to get away into the night, tumbles to the ground only to realize that the beating of their hearts is the only sound. At this point, an unlikely conga takes over from the bass and guitar (which were busy representing "running"), and delivers one of the world's most mundane solos: the bu-bump beating of a heart. It's as if the songs picks up the opportunity missed by Herman's Hermits 1966 hit, ["Can't You Hear My Heartbeat."][6]

A more fleeting, but perhaps slightly more "naturalistic" heartbeat permeates 10cc's classic slow burn ["I'm Not in Love."][7] While the most memorable moment of this song is probably the "big boys don't cry" whispering in the instrumental break, the opening heartbeat bass line (which, rhythmically, is much like the now-ubiquitous "Be My Baby" drum beat), holds together a song that is always dangerously close to losing itself into its otherworldly vocal treatments and navel-gazing lyrics.

The act of heart-listening—whether via stethoscope, ear bud, or personal introspection ("listen to your heart")—is one that requires a particular kind of knowledge. In 1848, *The New York Journal of Medicine* noted that "the correct knowledge of \[sound] and of the laws of its transmission doubtless embarrasses many when commencing the study of auscultation and percussion." Your heartbeat, your cough, your wheeze, your internal monologue: to know your sounds is to know yourself.
