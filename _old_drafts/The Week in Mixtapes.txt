## The Week in Mixtapes
Just checked my RSS reader ([Reeder][1], actually) for the first time in a few days and realized that some great audio hit the internet this week. The first is a ‘reissue’ of sorts, as Wayne Marshall ([wayneandwax][2]) reposted [this][3] 2005 dub reggae mix he put together.

Also this week, the folks at [Vague Terrain][4] continue in their ‘audio editions’ series, which, inevitably, is some weird art music that I’ve never heard of but will ultimately come to love. Their curatorial ear is highly reliable right now. Check out the latest edition, which is No.7, [here][5].

And, just like every week, there’s a new [framework podcast][6]. If you don’t have this thing in a podcast feed, please get on it. It’s one of my favorite ways to spend an hour every week. In fact, in 2010 I made it one of my resolutions to listen to every framework released that calendar year. It took some catching up in December, but it was worth it, and now I’m hooked. It’s not too late to make that same deal with yourself in 2011.
