## Project and/or Life Logging

### Intro

One of the reasons I hacked together the [SIFTTTER script](http://craigeley.com/post/72565974459/sifttter-an-ifttt-to-day-one-logger) was because I didn't like what I saw as the messiness of tools like [Slogger](!g "Slogger"), which generated entries at such a level of detail that I found it cumbersome. However, recently even I have been more interested in tracking things throughout the day, mostly as a way to track how much time I'm spending on certain tasks.

I've recently noticed a spate of tools designed to help people track things in more narrative and dynamic ways, most notably the iOS app [Reporter](http://www.reporter-app.com/)—whose powers I briefly touched on [here](http://craigeley.com/post/78544953385/track-ambient-noise-with-reporter)—and the essential [Day One](!g "Day One Mac App"). After experimenting with some of these tools, I actually really came to see the value in them, especially in their ability to attach robust metadata to entries.





I experimented a little with `doing`, but I actually found myself wanting to attach even *more* information to the entries, and for the files to be able to be updated from my phone. So, naturally, I hacked together a system using a bunch of scripts that is borderline insane but also (IMHO) kind of awesome. I've been using it for the past week or so, and while it is *very* specific to my needs and interests, I thought I would share it here in case anyone else finds it useful.

### The Premise

This workflow started with me wanting to create a way to better manage and track my time when working at my laptop, but since expanded in a full-on "life logger," should you choose to use it that way.

is based around keeping a master project and life log that pulls information in from several separate sources: location data from [Location Helper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/location-helper-for-applescript/id488536386?mt=12); manually entered text via [Alfred](!g "Alfred Mac App"), completed tasks from a folder of Taskpaper-style files (running from their [their own instance of nvALT](http://craigeley.com/post/80876964138/running-multiple-instances-of-nvalt), and the reports generated by the Reporter app. This allows for easy entry when I am at my machine or when I am on the go, and adds my location and tags as metadata.

### The Setup

Since I don't live in the Terminal all day and wanted slightly more data associated with my , but I wanted to try a plaintext-only custom solution that I could use from my phone or my laptop. In truth, [Day One](!g "Day One Mac app") or Reporter would work fine for this—and actually be less expensive—but I wanted to see if I could hack together something myself. This is only worth it (if at all) if you are already using these apps and have a working knowledge of them.
