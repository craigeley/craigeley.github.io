# Cleaning Up Markdown Footnotes

Just a quick update to an [old post](http://craigeley.com/post/46089397285/the-digital-dissertator-markdown-footnote-update) on Markdown footnotes. 

I do all of my writing in Markdown, from these blog posts to [academic papers](http://craigeley.com/post/72447244823/new-in-print-making-them-talk-animals-sound-and). As I've [written before](http://craigeley.com/post/45896860184/the-digital-dissertator-academic-writing-and), one of the trickiest things I find about academic writing in Markdown is footnoting. My solution—outlined [here](http://craigeley.com/post/46089397285/the-digital-dissertator-markdown-footnote-update)—is to use [TextExpander][3646-001] to create timestamps and then page down to post them at the bottom. It works great, except for the fact that to engage the snippet (in my case ";ffn") you have to leave a space after the end of the sentence, thus creating a gap before your footnotes.

To clean all of those up in one fell swoop, I wrote a super simple service that will do it for you using `sed` and `grep` searching. You can download it [here](http://d.pr/nToW).

Even more interestingly, I learned that [MMD4](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/)—which is included by default in [Marked 2](!g "Marked2 app"), includes a new syntax for inline footnoting: simply adding `[^text to be footnoted]` to the end of a sentence. I can see this being super useful for certain short-form projects, though I still like to look at all my links at the bottom to see if a sources has been cited multiple times, *ibid* usage, etc.
