## Tumblr Post: Sounds of the South

> Lingold envisions a searchable archive of sound open to all. Wonder what a cicada sounds like? Search under "c." Need the difference between the "d" and "b" strings on a 5-string banjo? Check the \[sonic] dictionary.

> "There are a lot of reasons why someone might want to know what something sounds like," said Lingold, who grew up in Texas. "It may be useful for teachers. Or a poet or author may want to describe something—like the cutting of a tobacco leaf—but they've never heard it done so they can't describe it accurately."

Last week I had the opportunity to attend the [New Media in American Literary History Symposium][1] (hashtag [\#nmalh][2]), where many of the projects and conversations confronted and problematized notions of "the old" and "the new" as they relate to historical media production and consumption. Mary Caton Lingold's ["sonic dictionary" project][3] strikes me as something that would have fit in nicely at the conference as a great example of how some of the longest-held fantasies about sound recording—"the captivity of all manner of sound-waves heretofore designated as 'fugitive'"[^1]—can be enacted in a decentered and collaborative way via "new" media technologies. I've been lucky enough to virtually "meet" Mary Caton through the [SoundBox Project][4] at Duke, and this project has given me a bunch of ideas for assignments I would like to try out in my class on "The Nature of Sound / The Sound of Nature."

Not entirely unrelatedly, this item came across my desk from none other than my friend [Brian Johannesen][5], who makes some sweet Southern sounds [of his own][6].
