## The Sounds of Honest Abe
Perhaps one of my favorite records ever is *Abraham Lincoln (as read by Carl Sandburg, Walter Huston, Orson Welles, and Agnes Moorhead)*. It came out on the Decca Gold Label Series around February of 1951 for the whopping price of $4.95 ([source][1]). It’s a gem of an album, featuring great performers reading great texts, with only half of the tracks marred by the era’s penchant for pairing spoken word with sappy movie score music.

The movie score music makes sense, though, when considering that many spoken word performers were also movie stars. Here we have two: Walter Huston and Agnes Moorehead. Huston was a logical choice, having played Lincoln twenty years earlier in *D.W. Griffith’s Abraham Lincoln*. The screenplay for Griffith’s *Lincoln* was written by Stephen Vincent Benet, who wrote *John Brown’s Body*, and whose wife, Rosemary, wrote a poem called “Nancy Hanks,” which appears here read by Moorehead. Moorehead was probably chosen due to her connection with Orson Welles, which I talk about below.

These two movie stars didn’t get any famous Lincoln speeches, but instead serve to voice deceased poets. Moorehead reads Benet, and Huston reads “Lincoln, Man of the People” by Edwin Markham, “O Captain, My Captain,” by Walt Whitman, and “Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight” by Vachel Lindsay. All of these tracks feature sappy “orchestration,” perhaps none so revolting as “Nancy Hanks,” which ends with a kind of mashup of ”I’ve Been Working on the Railroad” and “America, the Beautiful.” Still, these are solid selections from the Lincoln canon.

The heavy hitters here, Sandburg and Welles, aren’t subjected to the orchestral treatment, and because of that, and their incredible voices, their work stands out here. Sandberg reads from his 3 volume biography, *Lincoln: The War Years*, which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for history in 1940. He was clearly fond of doing Lincoln readings of all varieties—in 1959 he narrated Aaron Copeland’s symphonic *Lincoln Portrait* and won a Spoken Word Grammy for it. (As an aside, [all of these people][2] have also narrated that piece. What?) Sandburg’s reading here is interesting because it sounds poorly recorded (above and beyond my record’s scratches), yet the musicality and versatility in his voice comes through remarkably clear. He’s loud then soft, high then low, solemn then spirited. Here’s an excerpt (you’ll need to really crank the volume):

Unsurprisingly, though, Welles steals the show. An absolute titan of radio, his Mercury Theatre on the Air is best remembered for “The War of the Worlds,” broadcast on October 30, 1938 ([listen][3]). However, several months earlier they did a production called “Abraham Lincoln,” in which Welles collected a variety of Lincoln’s writings and speeches into a radio play. Welles plays the title role. It’s likely that Agnes Moorhead also appears in this play; she was a friend of Welles and a regular member of the Mercury Theater. For 1938, the play certainly doesn’t skirt racial issues: one of the selections Welles reads is from the first Lincoln-Douglass Debates, where Lincoln said, “There is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence…” It’s a rather incredible piece, and you can download and listen to it [here][4].

On this particular album, though, Welles’ “Gettysburg Address” is the standout performance. Even his introduction to the piece is strangely touching. Have a listen:
